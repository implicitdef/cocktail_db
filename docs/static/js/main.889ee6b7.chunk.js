Given its long history, it\u2019s no wonder that every family has their own recipe. Some old recipes call for the butter to be mixed in at the last step \u2013 a process which enraged David Embury, author of 1948\u2019s The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks. \u201cThe lump of butter is the final insult,\u201d he says. \u201cIt blends with the hot rum just about as satisfactorily as warm olive oil blends with champagne!\u201d The secret to a rich, not-at-all-oily Hot Buttered Rum is to start by beating the butter, sugar, and spices together in a batter. This aerates the butter and allows it to mix more thoroughly with the hot water and rum. The batter portion of the recipe can be scaled up and frozen \u2013 in fact, it\u2019s a wonderful preparation to make at the start of a long, cold winter. We love this recipe from Leo Robitschek at NoMad Bar from New York City. It\u2019s simple, but you can put your own twist on it by adding spices like cinnamon or star anise to the batter.

Ultimately, our theory didn\u2019t pan out \u2013 recipes calling for more strawberries were uniformly worse than recipes that only called for one or two. More strawberries in the shaker meant more messy pulp getting in the way of the pour, and the flavor was so strawberry-forward that it flattened out the other flavors in the drink, obscuring the daiquiri it was meant to be. The clear winner ended up being the simplest: a classic rum sour ratio, and one single berry (or two, if yours are on the small side). Muddling the berry with the syrup first extracts a strong, fragrant flavor, but still allows the daiquiri structure to shine through. That said, you can still serve this as a blended drink!

We finally amassed the ingredients and gave it a shot \u2013 and golly, are we glad we did! The Safe Passage is a wonderful example of a drink that is more than the sum of its parts. Each sip is a multilayered delight of brine, herbs, citrus and bubbles. It\u2019s a twist on the Sweet Olive cocktail, which we tried soon after. The Sweet Olive is perfectly fine, but it pales in comparison to the Safe Passage. It\u2019s probably to do with the lemon juice, which really turns up the volume on the other components of the cocktail. The recipe calls for Castelvetrano olives, a minimally-brined meaty green olive. It\u2019s worth the hassle of trying to find them (Amazon carries them in the US), as your typical Spanish olive comes with a much saltier brine. If you must use regular green olive brine, cut it back to half and try the mix before adding more. The recipe also calls for Amaro Nardini and Prosecco, but you can try with any medium-bodied amaro, and any sparkling wine you like.

In this series of drinks, Difford uses a bit of butterscotch liqueur to impart a warm, buttery sweetness that truly reminds one of the pastries they imitate. That clever trick is used to best effect here in the Gingerbread, which combines the butterscotch with bourbon, ginger wine, and apple juice for a spicy little cookie of a cocktail. Delicious!

It wasn\u2019t until one of our users (thanks, JB!) wrote in to tell us about the Kangaroo that we learned that the humble \u201cvodka martini\u201d has a genuine pedigree of its own, appearing at least as far back as the late 40s in reprinted editions of David A. Embury\u2019s The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks. More lately, it shows up with this perfected ratio in Robert Simonson\u2019s 3-Ingredient Cocktails. Since vodka is nearly flavorless, the focus of the Kangaroo is on the bitters, the oils from the lemon twist, and most importantly, the vermouth. Many new drinkers, exposed only to the oxidized, dusty bottles of low-grade vermouth, think that they hate the stuff. The Kangaroo presents the perfect opportunity to change those opinions, and the new wave of creative, high-quality vermouths (like those made by Lo-Fi, Uncouth Vermouth, Imbue and other small-batch producers) can introduce a whole new character that Embury could only have dreamed of. While the Kangaroo is listed by Simonson as a three-ingredient cocktail, we\u2019d argue that it\u2019s actually four.

The orange juice and sparkling wine (Baiocchi calls for prosecco) take the edge off the bitter, making into a lovely, low-proof, brunch-style sipper. This can be made with Aperol, as well \u2013 but take care to pair it with a dry sparkling wine, to keep it from skewing too sweet.

A darker, vanilla-soaked aged rum (like the Zaya 12 Year we tried it with first) fights with the effervescence of the sparkling wine and the crispness of the lime and gin; a rum with less character provides the necessary backbone without overwhelming the delicate balance.

It\u2019s a lovely canvas for experimentation, though, so try it with your favorite amaro and see how you like it! A drink like this would typically be stirred, not shaken.

The original recipe also calls for Navy-strength gin; if you use regular-proof gin you can expect the drink to be a bit sweeter overall.

The Puka Punch, from Los Angeles\u2019 famous Tiki Ti, answers the question by taking you on a multi-layered rum adventure that starts with fruity honey, continues along to spice and caramel, ending with the dark smoke of the overproof Demerara rum slowly filtering to the bottom of the glass. This drink should be served with a straw, lest the drinker be subjected to a full face of overproof rum at first sip. Drinking from the bottom with the straw allows for the full gradient of rum flavors to come through, slowly blending in the overproof rum.

Over time, certain ingredients went unused \u2013 so Ebert came up with a delicious recipe to make use of those odd ducks. This original recipe is pretty high-octane, due to the healthy pour of overproof rum.

If you don\u2019t have a tasty overproof rum, strong dark rum makes for a decent substitute. Over the years, many versions of this recipe have cropped up in bars and recipe books and website, often with additional fruit juices to soften the blow.
