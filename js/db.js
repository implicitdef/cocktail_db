A barrel-aged gin could amplify the honey flavors of Bénédictine, while a more botanic-forward gin would play up the herbal notes instead.

Some old recipes call for the butter to be mixed in at the last step – a process which enraged David Embury, author of 1948’s The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks. “The lump of butter is the final insult,” he says. “It blends with the hot rum just about as satisfactorily as warm olive oil blends with champagne!”\nThe secret to a rich, not-at-all-oily Hot Buttered Rum is to start by beating the butter, sugar, and spices together in a batter. This aerates the butter and allows it to mix more thoroughly with the hot water and rum. The batter portion of the recipe can be scaled up and frozen – in fact, it’s a wonderful preparation to make at the start of a long, cold winter.\nWe love this recipe from Leo Robitschek at NoMad Bar from New York City.

For each serving of Hot Buttered Rum, you’ll need the same amount of rum as butter batter. So if you’ve got the Cocktail Party app set to show ounces, and you’re making one serving, you’ll need two ounces of rum and two ounces of the butter batter.

That doesn’t square with the name, but it does have the weight of public opinion behind it!\nMany of the recipes we found said that the drink was named after the 1971 film The French Connection. Unfortunately, we’ve found no evidence that this is the case, and at least a couple references to the drink’s popularity in the 60s, before either the movie or the book it was based on existed. It is possible, though, that it was named for the actual heroin-smuggling scheme that spawned both works – and if that’s so, perhaps the use of a French spirit and an Italian liqueur was a nod to the Corsican origin of the scheme’s masterminds.\nPersonally, we like it well enough with amaretto, but we love it with Grand Marnier (or any other full-bodied orange liqueur, like Caribbean shrubb).
