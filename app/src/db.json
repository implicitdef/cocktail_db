Cherry bitters weren’t around when Baker wrote his tome, but we’ve found them to be an excellent substitute for Angostura in this recipe. Originally, the Coctel Noz de Coco Tropical was served as a blended, frappe-style cocktail. You can make it this way – but we actually prefer it shaken, with the cherries muddled in the shaker beforehand, for a flavor less muted by cold ice.

It’s the perfect fix, and the resulting recipe is as delicious as it is beautiful.

When it’s as good as the Stumptown Vanilla Flip, classification doesn’t seem to matter as much. We were on the hunt for a new espresso cocktail to test when we stumbled across this gem from bartender Andrew Friedman at Seattle’s Liberty Bar in a back-issue of Imbibe magazine. The recipe intrigued us, on account of the huge proportion of vanilla liqueur (Friedman calls for Navan), as well as the meringue-style technique. It’s a bit of a pain to mix up, as it involves first creating the meringue, then shaking the other ingredients, and finally adding the meringue back in for one last shake. We’d say it’s worth it – the resulting drink is smooth, rich, and magnificently aromatic. We recommend serving it in a small glass that is quite wide and flat. On our first attempt, we served it in small sherry glasses; while it looked cute, the need to tip the glass to drink it meant that the merengue foam slipped to the other side of the glass, and our test subjects were never able to get a sip that contained both foam and liquid. That foam is a critical component of the Stumptown Vanilla Flip’s flavor and mouthfeel, so you’d do well to find a small dessert cup or champagne coupe to serve it in.

In a pinch, you can make it with a standard orange soda like Fanta or Orange Crush – but it’s even better as Young makes it, with an italian orange soda like Sanpellegrino Aranciata. You can get away with bottled orange juice here, but we implore you to try it with fresh-squeezed juice. You needn’t limit yourself to standard oranges, either – blood oranges, mandarins or tangerines will really make it shine.

Given its long history, it’s no wonder that every family has their own recipe. Some old recipes call for the butter to be mixed in at the last step – a process which enraged David Embury, author of 1948’s The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks. “The lump of butter is the final insult,” he says. “It blends with the hot rum just about as satisfactorily as warm olive oil blends with champagne!” The secret to a rich, not-at-all-oily Hot Buttered Rum is to start by beating the butter, sugar, and spices together in a batter. This aerates the butter and allows it to mix more thoroughly with the hot water and rum. The batter portion of the recipe can be scaled up and frozen – in fact, it’s a wonderful preparation to make at the start of a long, cold winter. We love this recipe from Leo Robitschek at NoMad Bar from New York City. It’s simple, but you can put your own twist on it by adding spices like cinnamon or star anise to the batter. Robitschek’s recipe calls for an aged Venezuelan rum, but you can try it with any aged rum that tickles your fancy.

Note that the butter and sugar measures are by volume; in the US, it’d be a stick of butter and a quarter-cup of sugar. This next part requires a little math. For each serving of Hot Buttered Rum, you’ll need the same amount of rum as butter batter. So if you’ve got the Cocktail Party app set to show ounces, and you’re making one serving, you’ll need two ounces of rum and two ounces of the butter batter. You’ll also need 2.5 times as much hot water as rum – in that same scenario, you’d need 5 ounces of hot water. In a heavy, heatproof mug or glass, add the rum, hot water, and batter.

More strawberries in the shaker meant more messy pulp getting in the way of the pour, and the flavor was so strawberry-forward that it flattened out the other flavors in the drink, obscuring the daiquiri it was meant to be. The clear winner ended up being the simplest: a classic rum sour ratio, and one single berry (or two, if yours are on the small side). Muddling the berry with the syrup first extracts a strong, fragrant flavor, but still allows the daiquiri structure to shine through. That said, you can still serve this as a blended drink! Add all the ingredients to a blender, toss in a few more berries, add a cupful of crushed ice, and blend to your desired texture. It won’t be as delicate and complex as the shaken version, but it’s more than acceptable on a hot day out by the pool.

Lindstedt uses Cocchi Americano, a white wine apéritif with a crisper, more bitter flavor profile than Lillet Blanc, another popular option. Both are lovely in this drink, but if you use Lillet you can expect it to be a little sweeter and a bit less flavorful.

The Sweet Olive is perfectly fine, but it pales in comparison to the Safe Passage. It’s probably to do with the lemon juice, which really turns up the volume on the other components of the cocktail. The recipe calls for Castelvetrano olives, a minimally-brined meaty green olive. It’s worth the hassle of trying to find them (Amazon carries them in the US), as your typical Spanish olive comes with a much saltier brine. If you must use regular green olive brine, cut it back to half and try the mix before adding more.

Unfortunately, we’ve found no evidence that this is the case, and at least a couple references to the drink’s popularity in the 60s, before either the movie or the book it was based on existed. It is possible, though, that it was named for the actual heroin-smuggling scheme that spawned both works – and if that’s so, perhaps the use of a French spirit and an Italian liqueur was a nod to the Corsican origin of the scheme’s masterminds.

Embury’s The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks. More lately, it shows up with this perfected ratio in Robert Simonson’s 3-Ingredient Cocktails. Since vodka is nearly flavorless, the focus of the Kangaroo is on the bitters, the oils from the lemon twist, and most importantly, the vermouth.

The Kangaroo presents the perfect opportunity to change those opinions, and the new wave of creative, high-quality vermouths (like those made by Lo-Fi, Uncouth Vermouth, Imbue and other small-batch producers) can introduce a whole new character that Embury could only have dreamed of. While the Kangaroo is listed by Simonson as a three-ingredient cocktail, we’d argue that it’s actually four.

Their blue curaçaos are no exception, flavored with supporting elements like vanilla and other citrus that help to round out a drink that depends on a lot of the stuff to get the right color. If you don’t have the blue stuff, you can use orange curaçao (or triple sec, or orange shrubb), with a drop or two of blue food dye added.

But it deserves to be forgiven for the sins of its era, because underneath all that glitz and hype is a genuinely solid drink. By itself, the “Martini” part of the drink verges on saccharine sweetness; early versions of the recipe had even more sweetness, calling for vanilla vodka and an extra dose of vanilla syrup. This modern variation is still nearly too sweet – but that’s where the sidecar comes in. Alternating between sips of the main drink and the fizzy sparkling wine on the side brings the whole thing into a wonderful balance, and feels utterly decadent. Traditionally, the drink is garnished with a halved fresh passion fruit floating in the glass. It’s probably sacrilegious to even suggest serving it without, but we never bother with it.

It’s a lovely canvas for experimentation, though, so try it with your favorite amaro and see how you like it! A drink like this would typically be stirred, not shaken.

That’s why we’re really diggin’ the How to Kill a Friend, from Paul Shanrock at Seattle’s Stampede Club – it’s a case study in the emergent magical properties of a drink with a perfectly-tuned balance between a few dominant flavors. Here, the players are smoky mezcal, bitter Campari, and the decadent raisin overload of Pedro Ximénez sherry, the sweetest of all sherries. They balance each other like the three legs of a stool, resting on the shag-carpet rug of citrus, pineapple, and bitters. It’s such a careful balancing act that we’re inclined to recommend no substitutions here. We did try it with Aperol, the sweetest and most approachable bitter citrus apéritif – and the stool collapsed, resulting in a too-sweet drink with an overload of smoke. You could probably get away with Gran Classico or Luxardo Bitter or the like, but this drink really was made for Campari.

The original recipe for the Nilsson Schmillson, as printed in PUNCH, calls for coconut cream. But the recipe’s notes clarify that it’s not a true coconut cream (which is typically unsweetened, and quite thick) – rather, it’s a mix of coconut milk and cream of coconut (a much sweeter product). We’ve done our best to replicate that mixture in a single-serving recipe, but you may wish to play with the ratio of milk to cream to get it just how you like it. Oertel uses a homemade vanilla syrup. We tried the recipe with an off-the-shelf syrup, and found it just a tad too sweet and vanilla-dominant. We now make it with a very scant measure of vanilla syrup; you may need to experiment to find your ideal proportions. The original recipe also calls for Navy-strength gin; if you use regular-proof gin you can expect the drink to be a bit sweeter overall. Despite all the tinkering required, the Nilsson Schmillson is a worthy drink, and a rare example of how sake can be used to soften and flavor a drink with a stronger spirit as the backbone.

Back in the early ’70s when it was created, the tiki bar allowed guests to pour their own drinks from the bar’s collection. Over time, certain ingredients went unused – so Ebert came up with a delicious recipe to make use of those odd ducks. This original recipe is pretty high-octane, due to the healthy pour of overproof rum. The rum you choose should be flavorful despite its proof, so avoid the bottom-shelf fire-starter rums and look for something like Lemon Hart, Hamilton, Don Q, or Gosling’s. If you don’t have a tasty overproof rum, strong dark rum makes for a decent substitute. Over the years, many versions of this recipe have cropped up in bars and recipe books and website, often with additional fruit juices to soften the blow. We’ve cobbled those recipes together into one ideal version and added it here as the Rum Runner Deluxe – so check that one out if you’re looking for something with a bit less bite to it!

Strong, fragrant, exotic – everything we want in a tiki cocktail. The original recipe calls for the glass to be rinsed in absinthe blanc, a colorless variety of absinthe. You can use green absinthe, but it’ll give the final drink a slightly muddier color. It tastes the same, though, so you can just serve it in an opaque tiki mug and call it a day. The recipe also calls for Lemon Hart 151, a particularly flavorful overproof rum. You can use other good-tasting overproof rum brands, but stay away from anything that smells like gasoline – for example, Bacardi 151 is particularly foul in such a large proportion. Cate instructs the reader to garnish with a double-helix of grapefruit and lime twists. We found this pretty difficult, at first – the trick is to use thin strips of peel. Thicker strips will relax and untwist as soon as you put them in the drink, but thin strips of peel twisted together will stay twisted for longer. We twist ours before we start making the drink, and we use chip clips to hold the ends together until we’re ready to use the twists.
