[{"url":"/drinks/ballad-of-a-thin-man/","imgSrc":"/wp-content/uploads/Ballad-Of-A-Thin-Man.png","name":"Ballad of a Thin Man","desc":" Minnesota is a state settled in large part by Scandinavian immigrants, and when they arrived on America’s shores they brought with them a fondness for aquavit, a spirit flavored with caraway and dill. That legacy lives on to this day – the state now produces at least 16 local brands of aquavit, and local bars offer a wide array of aquavit cocktails. Ballad of a Thin Man is among our favorite of these. Hailing from the Icehouse bar and restaurant in Minneapolis, it’s a patio-friendly summer highball – perfect for Minnesota’s surprisingly sweltering summers.
